## Abstract 

Image steganography refers to embedding secret messages within cover images while maintaining imperceptibility. Recent advances in deep learning—primarily driven by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and architectures such as inverse neural networks, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks—have led to notable progress. However, these frameworks are primarily built on CNN architectures, which treat images as regular grids and are limited by their receptive field size and a bias toward spatial locality. In parallel, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated strong adaptability in several computer vision tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with architectures such as Vision GNN (ViG). This work moves in that direction and introduces StegGNN—a novel autoencoder-based, cover-agnostic image steganography framework based on GNNs. By modeling images as graph structures, our approach leverages the representational flexibility of GNNs over the grid-based rigidity of conventional CNNs. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets to evaluate visual quality and imperceptibility. Our results show that our GNN-based
method performs comparably to existing CNN benchmarks. These findings suggest that GNNs provide a promising al-
ternative representation for steganographic embedding and open the field of deep learning-based steganography to further exploration of GNN-based architectures.
